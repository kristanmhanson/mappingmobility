## Digital Approaches to Studying Art, Gendered Spatial Practices, and Plant Distribution Networks

### Tackling A Thorny Issue

Mobility or the degree to which certain kinds of women were, or were not, able to walk freely in public is a central issue of gender history. It is also an especially thorny one for historians who study cultural representations of modern women city dwellers that were produced in Western Europe during the second half of the nineteenth century. During that period, a patriarchal ideology of separate spheres deemed it proper for genteel white women of the upper-middle classes to spend their days confined within the domestic realm and, conversely, for men to participate in and even freely roam about the public one.

Although present-day historians agree that that dichotomous paradigm fails to account for the varied experiences of real women and the rich meanings of their portrayals in art, literature, and culture, it nevertheless holds enduring significance for our understanding of the past. That is so because there are few surviving firsthand accounts of walking that were authored by women, especially those who were poor or working class, or members of marginalized groups. Given the scarcity of such primary sources, the digital humanities offer innovative tools for using qualitative historical data to generate new frameworks to study art that engaged with gendered spatial practices and societal beliefs about mobility.

### Mobility in Parisian Art of the 1870s

My concern here is with the gender-historical issue of mobility as it pertains to visual representations of modern women who are shown transporting bouquets, fresh cut flowers, and potted plants in Parisian urban spaces.[^1]

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various 
literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.
