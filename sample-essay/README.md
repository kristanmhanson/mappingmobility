## Digital Approaches to Studying Art, Gendered Spatial Practices, and Plant Distribution Networks

### Tackling A Thorny Issue

Mobility or the degree to which certain kinds of women were, or were not, able to walk freely in public is a central issue of gender history. It is also an especially thorny one for historians who study cultural representations of modern women city dwellers that were produced in Western Europe during the second half of the nineteenth century. During that period, a patriarchal ideology of separate spheres deemed it proper for genteel white women of the upper-middle classes to spend their days confined within the domestic realm and for men to participate in and even be free to roam about the public one.

Although present-day historians agree that that dichotomous paradigm fails to account for the varied experiences of real women and the rich meanings of their portrayals in art, literature, and culture, it nevertheless holds enduring significance for our understanding of the past. That is so because there are few surviving firsthand accounts of walking that were authored by women, especially those who were poor or working class, or members of marginalized groups. Given the scarcity of such primary sources, the digital humanities offer innovative tools for using qualitative historical data to generate visualizations and such interactive mappings can provide, as I will show, an exciting new framework to study art, gendered spatial practices, and plant distribution networks.

### Mobility in Parisian Art of the 1870s

In this paper, I will present a project that uses historical geocoding and digital mapping to explore the gender-historical issue of mobility as it relates to Parisian art, society, and plant culture. The project maps the locations shown in paintings of Parisian women, ornamental plants, and urban spaces and those of flower markets and florist shops published in print sources. These maps visualize sites where an all-female labor force distributed and then sold fresh flora to a mostly female clientele who transported it to domestic and other spaces. My discussion of the project will clarify how paintings and maps chart an expanded field of mobility for women who moved plants. It will also propose a new rhizomatic model for studying gendered spatial practices that is structured by the same logic as the centrifugal urban plan and open grid of Paris.[^1]

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various 
literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.
