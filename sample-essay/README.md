# Sample visual essay

Mobility or the degree to which certain kinds of women were, or were not, able to walk freely in public is a central issue of gender history for many scholars who work on the nineteenth century. This issue is especially thorny for historians who study cultural representations of modern women produced in the latter half of the century. In the case of French literature and art in particular, scholars regularly invoke the separate spheres model to interpret how portrayals of women responded to gendered spatial practices. This model construes the metropolis as divided spatially along gender and class lines that also affected oneâ€™s freedom of movement: Although men were able to move freely within and across the public and the private spheres, women were restricted mainly to the latter, which could take the form of a home or brothel depending on their social status. Still, scholars agree that this paradigm fails to account for the experiences of a whole range of actual women, though my concern here is with those who transported plants.

In this paper, I will present a project that uses historical geocoding and digital mapping to explore the gender-historical issue of mobility as it relates to Parisian art, society, and plant culture. The project maps the locations shown in paintings of Parisian women, ornamental plants, and urban spaces and those of flower markets and florist shops published in print sources. These maps visualize sites where an all-female labor force distributed and then sold fresh flora to a mostly female clientele who transported it to domestic and other spaces. My discussion of the project will clarify how paintings and maps chart an expanded field of mobility for women who moved plants. It will also propose a new rhizomatic model for studying gendered spatial practices that is structured by the same logic as the centrifugal urban plan and open grid of Paris.[^1]

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various 
literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.
